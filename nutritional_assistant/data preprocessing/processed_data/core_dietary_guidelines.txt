**Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes Dietary Recommendations**

**Health Focus:**
Promote long-term health and prevention of chronic diseases through sustainable food choices.

**Weight Management:**

* Recommend ≥5% weight loss for overweight/obese individuals.
* Use a multifactorial lifestyle approach; no strict diet prescriptions.
* BMI thresholds: Overweight = 25–30 kg/m² (<70 yrs), Obese ≥30 kg/m².

**Core Dietary Guidelines (Food-Focused):**

* Prioritize **whole, minimally processed foods** in meal preparation.

* Encourage daily intake of:

  * **Vegetables** (e.g., leafy greens, broccoli, bell peppers – steamed, stir-fried, or raw in salads)
  * **Fruits** (fresh, whole fruits – in smoothies or as snacks; avoid juices)
  * **Whole grains** (brown rice, oats, quinoa – in bowls, porridge, or baked goods)
  * **Legumes** (chickpeas, lentils, black beans – in soups, stews, salads)
  * **Dairy** (low-fat milk, yogurt – as snacks or in smoothies)

* Limit use of:

  * **Sugar-sweetened beverages** – substitute with infused water or unsweetened herbal teas
  * **Salt** – use herbs/spices (like garlic, cumin, basil) instead; cap total salt at ≤6g/day
  * **Red/processed meats** – replace with fish, poultry, tofu, or legumes in recipes

* Promote **plant-forward meals** – more plant-based ingredients, less reliance on animal products.

**Beverage and Snack Tips:**

* Avoid fruit juices; prioritize fiber-rich whole fruits or fruit in recipes.
* Choose healthy snacks: nuts, cut fruits, yogurt, or homemade granola.

**Recommended Dietary Patterns:**

  * e.g., vegetable-rich pasta dishes with olive oil, lentil-based soups, grain bowls
* Carbohydrate-restricted meals can help short-term but are not universally endorsed for long-term.

**Personalized Guidance:**

* Ensure meals remain nutritionally balanced even when energy-restricted.

**Food Prep Suggestions:**

* Swap refined carbs with whole grains in familiar recipes (e.g., whole wheat pasta instead of white).
* Cook beans in bulk and store for easy inclusion in meals.
* Batch-cook vegetable soups or stews with legumes for convenient, diabetes-friendly options.
* Use spices and herbs to enhance flavor without added sugar or salt.

**Lifestyle Integration:**

* Pair healthy eating with regular physical activity.
* Avoid smoking and prioritize consistent, home-cooked meals over processed options.

**Policy Implications:**
Support healthy eating patterns in community health initiatives and diabetes care planning.
